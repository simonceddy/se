        I started writing basic HTML sites when I was about 14 and have steadily progressed since (in between careers). Nowadays, most of my work is with PHP and JavaScript.

      <p className="m-4">
        Outside writing code, I love music and am a semi-active guitarist, bassist, and Ableton Live wizard (though I prefer Logic for mixing, just FYI). My favourite artist is the UK electronic duo Autechre, although I mostly listen to music that's a little bit heavier. Don't worry - I'm pretty good at keeping it to myself (usually).

        I have worked as an Audio Engineer (including a couple of sessions in Sing Sing Studios - life highlight) and have a keen interest in sound recording and synthesis.
